## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I really utilised negative margins for overlapping stuff in this project. I only realised their value not long ago, and am loving how useful they are! I also had to use a fair bit of relative/absolute positioning which helped me practice that.

I learned how to make a slider too. I learnt how to enable use of keyboard arrow keys to focus and select elements in the HTML using the focus() method.
